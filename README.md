# PASSWORD GENERATOR CHALLENGE

* AS A moron who does not understand this assignment

* I AM trying my best to put the code together for a password generator.

* I WANT to improve my skills at writing Javascript by continuing to work on this project and resubmitting later.

* SO THAT I can gain a better understanding and become a successful developer.
